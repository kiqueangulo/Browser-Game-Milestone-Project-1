            <b>Rhymeable Knowledge</b> is about guessing words that rhyme with a random or chosen word (the guide word), 
            having their definition, typo of word, and one letter uncover as clues.
        </p>
        <h3>LEVELS</h3>
        <p>
            Each word has three(3) levels. Level 1: you will have 5 words (rhymes) to guess; level 2: you will have
            3 words to guess; and finally, level 3: you will have 1 word to guess. The difficulty increases 
            as you advance through levels.
        </p>
        <h3>ATTEMPS</h3>
        <p>
            You will count with 5 lives (represented with hearts). To attemps represent 1 heart, and your lives goes 
            from level 1 to level 3 for each guide word. Therefore, you have ten opportunities per word to complete its 3 levels.
        </p>
